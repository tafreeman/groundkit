"""Path safety helpers for validating locally-contained file paths.

Ported from ARP (`agentic_v2/utils/path_safety.py`) per ADR-0001.

Containment is decided with ``os.path.commonpath`` over fully realpath-ed
operands. That is deliberate: it is the barrier pattern CodeQL recognizes for
``py/path-injection``. ``Path.is_relative_to`` (and the ``in .parents`` check
before it) are equivalent in behavior but are not treated as sanitizers.

The check is inlined in both public helpers rather than shared through a third
function so each one carries the barrier in the same frame as the value it
returns.
